    "question_1 = \"\\n\\n\\nQ: You guys write the copy yourself, right?\\n\\nA: Correct, we handle the writing of the copy ourselves. However, we do so with your input. During the onboarding process, you'll provide us with the necessary information and messaging for the campaign. We'll then take that information and craft the copy in a way that aligns with our style and follows best practices for cold emailing. You'll have the opportunity to review and approve the copy before it's used, or provide feedback for any revisions.\"\n",
    "question_2 = \"\\n\\n\\nQ: How many emails is that per week that you send out?\\n\\nA:   Our typical email campaign consists of contacting 125 to 250 new prospects per day, which amounts to approximately 1000 emails per week. The campaign is designed to reach between 2500 and 5000 unique prospects per month, and these prospects will be sent a four-email sequence spaced out over a two-week period. The emails are designed to be friendly and authentic, introducing the company and its products or services, and encouraging the recipient to take action.\"\n",
    "question_3 = \"\\n\\n\\nQ: Is it email or do you message through LinkedIn?\\n\\nA: We only use email for outreach and communication with prospects. LinkedIn is used for research to identify potential prospects, but the messaging function on LinkedIn is often oversaturated and may not be as effective for communication.\"\n",
